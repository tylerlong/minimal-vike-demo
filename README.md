# Minimal Vike Demo

This repo hosts a minimal Vike Demo. It tries to be as minimal as possible while
still demonstrates major features of Vike.

## Run in dev mode

```
yarn vike dev
```

## Notes

This repo tries to build everything from scratch. I may not be the best way. You
may want to use `vike-react` instead.
